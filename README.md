### Description
The focus of this project is looking at electricity generation and emissions to see if there is a relationship with temperature and air quality by region in the US.  Our rationale is that with climate change, our transition from coal to cleaner fuels and our changing EPA rules we should see some interesting trends over these last few years.  Questions we are hoping to answer include: is our air getting cleaner, are different parts of the country faring better or worse, is there a relationship between emissions and temperature?
